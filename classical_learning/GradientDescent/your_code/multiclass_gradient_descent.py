class MultiClassGradientDescent:

    Implements linear gradient descent for multiclass classification. Uses
    One-vs-All (OVA) classification for aggregating binary classification
    results to the multiclass setting.

    Arguments:
        loss - (string) The loss function to use. One of 'hinge' or 'squared'.
        regularization - (string or None) The type of regularization to use.
            One of 'l1', 'l2', or None. See regularization.py for more details.
        learning_rate - (float) The size of each gradient descent update step.
        reg_param - (float) The hyperparameter that controls the amount of
            regularization to perform. Must be non-negative.

        Fits a multiclass gradient descent learner to the features and targets

        output classes, train a GradientDescent classifier to determine whether
        each example does or does not belong to that class.

        Store your c GradientDescent classifiers in the list self.model. Index
        c of self.model should correspond to the binary classifier trained to
        predict whether examples do or do not belong to class c.

            targets - (np.array) A 1D array of targets of size N. Contains c
                unique values (the possible class labels).
            batch_size - (int or None) The number of examples used in each
                iteration. If None, use all of the examples in each update.
            max_iter - (int) The maximum number of updates to perform.

            self.model - (list) A list of c GradientDescent objects. The models
                trained to perform OVA classification for each class.
