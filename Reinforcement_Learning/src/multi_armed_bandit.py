        rather than exploiting the best action.

        Trains the MultiArmedBandit on an OpenAI Gym environment.

        See page 32 of Sutton and Barto's book Reinformcement Learning for
        pseudocode (http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2018.pdf).
        Initialize your parameters as all zeros. For the step size (alpha), use
        1 / N, where N is the number of times the current action has been
        performed. Use an epsilon-greedy policy for action selection.

        See (`https://gym.openai.com`/) for examples of how to use the OpenAI
        Gym Environment interface.

        Hints:
          - Use env.action_space.n and env.observation_space.n to get the
            number of available actions and states, respectively.
          - Remember to reset your environment at the end of each episode. To
            do this, call env.reset() whenever the value of "done" returned
            from env.step() is True.
          - If all values of a np.array are equal, np.argmax deterministically
            returns 0.
          - In order to avoid non-deterministic tests, use only np.random for
            random number generation.
          - MultiArmedBandit treats all environment states the same. However,
            in order to have the same API as agents that model state, you must
            explicitly return the state-action-values Q(s, a). To do so, just
            copy the action values learned by MultiArmedBandit S times, where
            S is the number of states.

        Arguments:
          env - (Env) An OpenAI Gym environment with discrete actions and
            observations. See the OpenAI Gym documentation for example use
            cases (https://gym.openai.com/docs/).

            during training.

          state_action_values - (np.array) The values assigned by the algorithm
            to each state-action pair as a 2D numpy array. The dimensionality
            of the numpy array should be S x A, where S is the number of
            states in the environment and A is the number of possible actions.
          rewards - (np.array) A 1D sequence of averaged rewards of length 100.
            Let s = np.floor(steps / 100), then rewards[0] should contain the
            average reward over the first s steps, rewards[1] should contain
            the average reward over the next s steps, etc.
